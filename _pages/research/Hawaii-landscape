<h2><b>Effects of weathering in the landscape evolution of Hawaiian islands</b></h2> 
Knowing when and where do rivers form is important to understanding the response of surface and groundwater budgets to progressively wetter or drier climates. Climate, lithology and biota control the architecture of the Critical Zone through erosion, fluid residence times and chemical weathering. Basaltic rocks are extremely reactive and young basaltic terrains are   highly porous &mdash; imagine a lava tube! Thus, chemical weathering in these environments can have a large impact on groundwater and runoff budgets.
