<h2><b>Fractionation of Ge/Si ratios in clays, how to move forward to use them in geochemical codes</b></h2> 
Ge/Si ratios are useful weathering tracers. So far, we have been using Ge/Si ratios empirically, based on global estimates of Ge/Si in rivers and soils. A thermodynamic basis to the partitioning behavior of Ge into clays is necessary to incorporate Ge/Si ratios into geochemical modeling codes &mdash; such as a CrunchFlow, Phreeqc or GWB. These codes use the solubility of minerals. However, until today there is no thermodynamic data for alumino-germanate clays &mdash; although, there is some thermo data for some phyllo-germanates (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0036023617110183">Shtenberg et al. 2017</a>).<br>
For Ge-bearing clays forming a solid-solution with Si, the fractionation factor depends on the stochiometry of the clay.<br>

<h2><b>Transient behavior of trace element geochemical tracers</b></h2> 
In natural systems several factors can influence how trace elements are partitioned into minerals. Fluid chemistry and dissolution/precipitation rates can affect Ge/Si ratios at short timescales. Although we don't have a complete understanding of the precipitation dynamics of secondary clays in the Critical Zone, we can couple geochemical tracers into RTMs to test for different scenarios. Using <a href="https://bitbucket.org/crunchflow/crunchtope/wiki/Home">CrunchFlow's</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703713003098"><i>isotope block</i></a>, we can model the fractionation of isotope and trace element tracers &mdash; such as Ge/Si ratios &mdash; and test for factors influencing precipitation mechanisms.
