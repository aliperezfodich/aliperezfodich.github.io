<h2><b>Environmental controls on silica precipitation in geothermal fields</b></h2> 
Understanding the effects of varying environmental conditions in active hydrothermal springs can allow us to understand the evolution of ancient and extinct hydrothermal systems. Also, fossil sinter deposits not only record textures, but are also archives to the geochemistry of precipitating fluids. Using observations from precipitation experiments in active systems we aim to better reconstruct past environmental conditions that might have influenced precipitation rates and the geochemistry in ancient hydrothermal fields.

<h2><b>Understanding biogeochemical signatures during silica precipitation</b></h2> 
Hydrothermal systems on Earth are inhabited by diverse microbial communities and we aim to identify potential biogeochemical signatures in sinters by studying their trace element and Si-isotopic composition.

The control case (perfect fractionation) is shown in blue and slower rate constants for a linear TST rate law in 0.5 log-units reductions.
