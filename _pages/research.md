<h2><b>Modeling weathering of volcanic rocks</b></h2> 
Reactive transport models (RTMs) are a useful tool to disentagle weathering processes. They allow us to solve for diffusion and advection of fluids and solutes through a porous media, and solve for chemical reactions between the fluid and solid phases. Thus, we can use RTMs to identify the controlling reactions in a weathering system and answer questions like: <br>
<i>What is the influence of water/rock ratios?</i> <br>
<i>How does biota affect to weathering rates?</i> <br>
<i>What is the influence of volcanic gases and geothermal springs in weathering of volcanic regions?</i><br>

<p style="font-size:small">The effect of addition of organic ligands and complexation on (a) free Al<sup>3+</sup> activity and (b) allophane saturation index at 20 kyr as a function of depth for a basalt weathering profile. The solid-line represents the results for M3 allowing complexation of Al with organic ligands. Dashed line shows M3 without complexation of Al with organic ligands. Dotted line shows the results for M2 with no organic ligands and no complexation. <br>
LMWOA complexation of Al lowers the activity of free Al<sup>3+</sup> by 5â€“6 orders of magnitude despite high total Al concentration and results in undersaturation with respect to secondary Al phases such as allophane. This mechanism appears central to the large aluminum losses observed in highly weathered Hawaiian soils.</p>

<h2><b>Fractionation of Ge/Si ratios in clays, how to move forward to use them in geochemical codes</b></h2> 
Ge/Si ratios are useful weathering tracers. So far, we have been using Ge/Si ratios empirically, based on global estimates of Ge/Si in rivers and soils. A thermodynamic basis to the partitioning behavior of Ge into clays is necessary to incorporate Ge/Si ratios into geochemical modeling codes &mdash; such as a CrunchFlow, Phreeqc or GWB. These codes use the solubility of minerals. However, until today there is no thermodynamic data for alumino-germanate clays &mdash; although, there is some thermo data for some phyllo-germanates (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0036023617110183">Shtenberg et al. 2017</a>).<br>
For Ge-bearing clays forming a solid-solution with Si, the fractionation factor depends on the stochiometry of the clay.<br>

<h2><b>Transient behavior of trace element geochemical tracers</b></h2> 
In natural systems several factors can influence how trace elements are partitioned into minerals. Fluid chemistry and dissolution/precipitation rates can affect Ge/Si ratios at short timescales. Although we don't have a complete understanding of the precipitation dynamics of clays in the critical zone, we can couple geochemical tracers into RTMs to test for different scenarios. Using CrunchFlow's <i>isotope block</i>, we can model the fractionation of isotope and trace element tracers &mdash; such as Ge/Si ratios &mdash; and test for factors influencing precipitation mechanisms.
