<h2><b>Reactive transport models of basalt weathering</b></h2> 
Reactive transport models (RTMs) are a useful tool to disentagle weathering processes. They allow us to solve for diffusion and advection of fluids and solutes through a porous media, and solve for chemical reactions between the fluid and solid phases. We can then identify the controlling reactions in a weathering system and answer questions like: <br>
<i>What is the influence of water/rock ratios?</i> <br>
<i>How does biota affect to weathering rates?</i> <br>
<i>What is the influence of volcanic gases and geothermal springs in weathering of volcanic regions?</i><br>
