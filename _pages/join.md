I am always looking for motivated students and talented postdocs to work with me in the Department of Geology at UChile.<br> 

Your research interests should be within the areas of (bio)geochemistry, geothermal systems, Critical Zone or reactive transport modeling.

Interested students should email me with a brief statement of your research interests and how those align with the current and previous research in the lab. Our department has full-time research MSc and PhD programs and our students can usually grant funding from an ANID graduate fellowship. Depending on your record, we can explore a broader range of funding options for MSc students.

If you are looking for **postdoc** opportunities and have a strong geochemistry background with clean lab/mass-spec experience or reactive transport modeling, I am  looking forward to working with you. Our lab has 2 mass-specs(1 MC-ICP-MS and 1 QQQ-MS) equipped with laser ablation for isotope and trace element analyses for samples in solution and in-situ analyses.
I might not have direct funding for your position, but we can write a postdoc research proposal for ANID (Chilean research agency). The funding rate is better compared to US/European based grants. The call opens in July-August with deadline by the end of September. The position should start somewhere between December and March.
