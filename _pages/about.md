I am a low-temperature geochemist from Chile, working towards my Ph.D. Cornell University working with Prof. Louis Derry and visiting student at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris under the ‘Make Our Planet Great Again’ program. Before my time at Cornell, I got M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Geology from the University of Chile.
