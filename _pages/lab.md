I am currently working on research projects on the weathering of the basalts in the SVZ of Chile and its relationship in the rate of consumption in the CO2 cycle.
Research interests: Hydrogeology and hydrogeochemistry as key tools for the information basis on national and international environmental issues. Water and its relationship in the conflicts of pollution, water drought and climate change. Involve Science with the communities and their territories.

At the moment I am studying the silica precipitation processes in the El Tatio geothermal field in the Chilean Altiplano, considering the Ge/Si ratios in the fluids. My interests go to the areas of Geochemistry, Paleoclimate, Volcanology and Geothermal Research, in persuit to link these different branches and improve the understanding of environmental geology.
